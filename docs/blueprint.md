# **App Name**: FusionFlow Reactor

## Core Features:

- Interactive Plasma Simulation: Visualize Deuterium (D) and Tritium (T) particles moving within a defined confinement zone, mirroring the dynamic behavior of plasma.
- Temperature Control Interface: Allow users to adjust the 'relative temperature' of the plasma, directly influencing particle velocities and collision energy thresholds for fusion.
- Fusion Event Visualization: Display a visual flash or particle effect when a D-T fusion reaction occurs, indicating a successful energy generation event.
- Real-time Telemetry Display: Show live updates for key metrics such as 'Relative Temperature' and 'Total Energy Generated' (in MeV) within the simulation.
- Automated Fuel Re-injection: Continuously inject new Deuterium and Tritium particles into the simulation after fusion events to maintain a steady and interactive reactor state.
- AI Plasma Configuration Assistant: An AI-powered tool that suggests optimal temperature or confinement settings for increased fusion rates, offering insights based on simulated dynamics and general fusion principles.

## Style Guidelines:

- The primary color, #0080FF (a vibrant electric blue), is chosen to evoke a sense of high energy and futuristic plasma, providing strong contrast against dark backgrounds.
- The background color, #16191C, is a deep, desaturated blue-gray, offering a dark and immersive canvas suitable for a scientific simulation, visually harmonious with the primary.
- An accent color, #7FF2FF (a bright cyan), will be used for interactive elements and highlights, analogous to the primary and ensuring distinct contrast and visibility.
- Headlines and prominent text will use 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), conveying a techy, scientific, and modern feel. Body text and longer descriptions will use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for its readability and clean aesthetic.
- Employ simple, clean, and subtly animated geometric icons to represent different particle types and controls, reinforcing the scientific simulation theme.
- The layout will feature a central, expansive simulation area for plasma visualization, with clearly separated and dedicated sections for real-time telemetry, control sliders, and the AI assistant, prioritizing a logical information hierarchy.
- Implement smooth and fluid particle movement animations. Introduce subtle pulse or glow effects for fusion events and gradual transitions for UI element state changes to enhance interactivity and visual feedback.
